# NFC Project

## Hardware requirements
You will need a NFC Reader compatible with Java Smart Card IO.<br/>
We personnaly used an ACR122.

## Grails installation
To execute this project, you will need to install [Grails](http://grails.org/download.html), [Java 1.8](https://www.java.com/fr/download/), and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/).<br/>
We recommend that you use IntelliJ as it has a great support for Grails and its plugins.<br/>

## Before you run
Don't forget to **adapt your application.yml** to your proper configuration.<br/>
By default, we run grails on the port 8081 (line 139), and the context path is /tp (line 137).<br/>

## Running the Front-End
First, you need to install NodeJS.
Then, go to **front-end** folder in the root directory.
Run **"npm install"** on command line till it is complete.
Run **"ng serve"** then the application will be running on port 4200 at "localhost".
