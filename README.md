## Grails installation
To execute this project, you will need to install [Grails](http://grails.org/download.html), [Java 1.8](https://www.java.com/fr/download/), and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/).<br/>
We recommend that you use IntelliJ as it has a great support for Grails and its plugins.<br/>


## Before you run
Don't forget to **adapt your application.yml** to your proper configuration.<br/>
By default, we run grails on the port 8081 (line 139), and the context path is /tp (line 137).<br/>
